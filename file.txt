⭐ The Story of the Two Seeds

Once, two tiny seeds lay side by side in the soil. Both dreamed of growing into big trees one day.

The first seed said, “I want to grow!” So it pushed its roots into the earth. Slowly it broke through the soil, grew leaves, and reached for the sunlight. Even when rain, wind, and insects challenged it, the seed stayed strong and continued to grow.

The second seed was afraid.
“What if my roots go too deep and I can’t breathe?”
“What if I grow leaves and animals eat them?”
“What if I grow tall and strong winds break me?”
So the second seed stayed where it was, hiding under the soil.

One day, a hungry bird came searching for food. It found the second seed easily and ate it. But the first seed had grown into a young plant, safe and strong.

⭐ Moral of the Story

If you want to grow in life, take risks, face challenges, and move forward.
Fear may keep you safe for a moment, but it can stop you from becoming something great.
